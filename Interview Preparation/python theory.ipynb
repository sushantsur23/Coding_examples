    "A metaclass in Python is a class of a class that defines how a class behaves. Classes themselves are instances of metaclasses. You can customize class creation by defining a metaclass, such as modifying class properties, adding methods, or implementing design patterns. A common use case for metaclasses is enforcing coding standards or design patterns, such as singleton, or auto-registering classes."

    "__slots__ is a special attribute in Python that allows you to explicitly declare data members (slots) and prevent the creation of __dict__, thereby reducing memory overhead. By using __slots__, you can limit the attributes of a class to a fixed set of fields and reduce the per-instance memory consumption. This is particularly beneficial when creating a large number of instances of a class."
